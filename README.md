![Intro ](Penetration-Testing-Main.jpg)

Welcome to the CompTIA PenTest+ Labs repository! This repository contains a collection of labs created during my study journey for the CompTIA PenTest+ certification exam.

## About This Repository 📘

This repository serves as a collection of hands-on labs I completed while studying for the CompTIA PenTest+ certification. Each lab is designed to reinforce concepts covered in the PenTest+ exam objectives and provide practical experience in penetration testing and vulnerability management.

## About CompTIA PenTest+ 📚

CompTIA PenTest+ is a certification for cybersecurity professionals tasked with penetration testing and vulnerability management. It covers various aspects of penetration testing, including planning and scoping, information gathering and vulnerability identification, attacks and exploits, penetration testing tools, and reporting and communication.
